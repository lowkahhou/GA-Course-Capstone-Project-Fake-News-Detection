Detection of Fake News Generated by Bot

Objective: Build a model to distinguish fake news generated by OpenAI's GPT-2

This repository contains 4 python scripts:
	1) Web Scrapping of 7,700 real articles from The Straits Times and TodayOnline
	2) Use of OpenAI GPT-2 language model to generate 7,700 fake articles based on first 50 words of each real articles
	3) Preprocess data for modelling
	4) Perform text classification (binary fake or not fake) using 2 appraoches:
		Approach 1: Count-based word embedding + various traditional ML models
			a) Logistics Regression
			b) Random Forest
			c) Linear SVM
			d) XGBoost
			e) Naive Bayes

		Approach 2: Word Embedding (GloVe) + LSTM
